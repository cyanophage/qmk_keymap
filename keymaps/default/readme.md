# The default keymap for halmak_split

The layout is based on halmak (originally designed by Nikolay Nemshilov) although a few adjustments have been made. I have swapped the positions of B and D. As the keyboard was originally designed for a staggered layout the position of the G on an ortholinear keyboard was non-optimal so I moved the G to above the A, the Q one key to the left, and put the semi-colon where the G was.
