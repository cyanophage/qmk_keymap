When I first created this keyboard I used a modified halmak layout. I originally chose this layout because I liked the very low usage of the two central columns. For me I find reaching inwards with my fingers to be uncomfortable. Although I was typing at 90 wpm on this layout I knew that there were problems with it. There were certain common words that were uncomfortable to type. This is mainly because of the same finger bigrams on the right hand ie AP GA BO. Words like 'again', 'bike', 'book'. So for the much of 2023 I was on the lookout for a new layout. I wanted a layout that had the same low inner column usage of halmak but had much lower same finger bigrams like some of the modern layouts like canary or gallium. Engram was the only layout out there that was close to what I wanted but still had some flaws I didn't like.

So I created my own layout: Carbyne.
